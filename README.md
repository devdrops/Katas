SensioLabs PoleDev Katas
========================

Here is some exercises around the Symfony2 framework! Once a day, a new Kata to practice yourself :)

Navigate among branches of the repository to find hapiness.

Basically, it's about following each step described in the README file, then repeat it until you can code the exercise really quickly. It's about getting reflexes and learn some peace of knowledge, exercise by exercise.

Enjoy!
